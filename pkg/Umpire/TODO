FUNCTION LIST FOR UMPIRE 2.0: CLINICAL EXPANSION:
O estimateClinicalParameters
	given a certain number of final parameters, estimate hit function, nPossible, block sizes
	outputs a list of suggested values as inputs for clinicalModel, clinicalNoiseModel, & clinicalHyperParameters
--->
D clinicalModel
	a CancerModel for clinical data
D clinicalHyperParameters
	blockHyperParameters with clinical defaults
D clinicalNoiseModel

--->
O ClinicalEngine
	takes as inputs the ClinicalModel, clinicalHyperParameters, clinicalNoiseModel

Cat's Concerns from Man Page Writing

PROBLEMS/CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE MAN PAGES:
ClinicalEngine didn't throw an error for lacking documentation. My impression is that it needs standalone 
documentation with rand and summary methods implemented. Thoughts?

This is the documentation from the original package for the CancerEngine documentation. Was this an omission?    
    \item{rand}{\code{signature(object = "CancerEngine")}: :TODO: }
    \item{summary}{\code{signature(object = "CancerEngine")}: :TODO: }  }

How much detail should we go into Re: the details on the man page for setDataTypes?

QUESTION ABOUT THE VIGNETTE:
Could we have a conversation about your goals/vision/hopes and dreams for content and tone for the vignette?

PROBLEMS WITH THE TEST/DOCUMENTATION EXAMPLES:
In the test, the calls for nFeatures when generating the ClinicalEngine at the very beginning 
and when calling rand(mte) at the very end are for 20 features, but the data set being output has 
50 features. What's going on?

PROBLEMS WITH THE CODE:
showClass("NoiseModel") has uninformative output for the ClinicalNoiseModel

There is a problem with NoiseModel taking in the ClinicalNoiseModel that we missed in my thesis: 
NoiseModel-AdditiveScale takes in a single, numeric value - which means it's applying the first 
value generated by the gamma distribution to all features, as opposed to something more useful. 
This probably needs to get addressed in the definitions of the type in each slot and in blur.

Do we need a meaningful summary method for MixedTypeEngine? (These exist for all the other engines.) 

Right now summary(mte) returns the summary output for a CancerEngine, which is only partially useful.

How do we confirm that all the dependencies are loading correctly? I had to load bimodalIndex and 
DirichletReg by hand, but I don't know if that's a problem with building just on my end.

Do we need error handling if a user tries to use something other than a matrix/data frame of 
continuous data for setDataTypes.  

I'm confused on ClinicalEngine (which is called in the test and we talked about) and CancerEngine. 
Although the test calls ClinicalEngine as a function, on package check in the examples 
the following error is returned:
  > ## generate a ClinicalEngine with 20 features and 4 clusters
  > ce <- ClinicalEngine(20, 4, TRUE)
  Error in ClinicalEngine(20, 4, TRUE) : 
    could not find function "ClinicalEngine"
  Execution halted

OLD To-Dos:
Bump for R-Forge
Added .Rsave.out files for the test suite.
