\title{
A Noise Model for Clinical Data
}
\description{
  A \code{ClinicalNoiseModel} represents the additional human and measurement 
  noise that is layered on top of any biological variabilty when measuring 
  clinical variables.
}
\usage{
ClinicalNoiseModel(shape = 1.02, scale = 0.05/shape)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{shape}{
      The \code{shape} gamma hyperparameter describing the standard 
      deviation of additive noise.
  }
  \item{scale}{
      The \code{scale} gamma hyperparameter describing the standard 
      deviation of additive noise.
  }
}
\details{
  We model both additive and multiplicative noise, so that the observed
  expression of clinical variable \var{c} in sample \var{i} is given by:
  \eqn{Y_ci = S_ci + E_ci}, where \var{Y_ci} = observed expression,
  \var{S_ci} = true biological signal.
  In the ClinicalNoiseModel (as opposed to the \code{\link{NoiseModel}}), 
  we model the additive noise as \eqn{E_ci ~ N(0,tau)}, 
  without multiplicative noise or an additive bias/offset in the clinical model. 
  The standard deviation hyperparameters of the additive noise \var{tau} 
  is modeled by the gamma distribution \eqn{tau ~ Gamma(shape, scale)}
