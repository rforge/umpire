O summary(mte)
	Do we need a meaningful summary method for MixedTypeEngine? (These exist for all the
	other engines.) Right now summary(mte) returns the summary output for a CancerEngine,
	which is only partially useful.

O Do we need error handling if a user tries to use something other than a matrix/data
	frame of continuous data for setDataTypes?

===========================
RESOLVED

::FIXED:: In the test, the calls for nFeatures when generating the ClinicalEngine
at the very beginning and when calling rand(mte) at the very end are for 20
features, but the data set being output has 50 features. What's going on?

::FIXED:: Added separate generic methods for 'nrow' and 'nComponents' in a 'CancerEngine'
so they provide the actual values.

::IGNORE:: How do we confirm that all the dependencies are loading correctly? I had to load
bimodalIndex and DirichletReg by hand, but I don't know if that's a problem with building
just on my end.
::NOTE:: When installed from CRAN using install.pacakages, all dependencies
will be installed uatomatically.

::FIXED (by exporting the function name):: I'm confused on ClinicalEngine (which is called in
the test and we talked about) and CancerEngine. Although the test calls ClinicalEngine as a
function, on package check in the examples the following error is returned:
  > ## generate a ClinicalEngine with 20 features and 4 clusters
  > ce <- ClinicalEngine(20, 4, TRUE)
  Error in ClinicalEngine(20, 4, TRUE) :
    could not find function "ClinicalEngine"
  Execution halted
::FIXED:: ClinicalEngine didn't throw an error for lacking documentation. My impression
is that it needs standalone documentation with rand and summary methods implemented. Thoughts?

::FIXED:: Using the ClinicalEngine to produce Weighted/unWeighted clusters produces clusters of
equal prevalence (4 clusters at .25 each) regardless of whether isWeighted is TRUE or FALSE.

::FIXED:: In setDataTypes, range is implemented differently in the top-level function
(range = 3:9; throws an "unused" error when run) and in the MakeCategories sub-function
(range=c(3,9)).

::IGNORE:: showClass("NoiseModel") has uninformative output for the ClinicalNoiseModel
::NOTE:: CLinicalNoiseModel is just a function, not a class. We simply reuse the original
NoiseModel class to implement it. Might want to creaste a sensible summary function for
the NoiseModel class.

::FIXED:: This is the documentation from the original package for the CancerEngine
documentation. Was this an omission?
    \item{rand}{\code{signature(object = "CancerEngine")}: :TODO: }
    \item{summary}{\code{signature(object = "CancerEngine")}: :TODO: }  }

::FIXED:: How much detail should we go into Re: the details on the man page for setDataTypes?

::FIXED:: There is a problem with NoiseModel taking in the ClinicalNoiseModel that we missed
in my thesis: NoiseModel-AdditiveScale takes in a single, numeric value - which means it's
applying the first value generated by the gamma distribution to all features, as opposed to
something more useful. This probably needs to get addressed in the definitions of the type
in each slot and in blur.
