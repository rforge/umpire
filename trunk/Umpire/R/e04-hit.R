# A HIT is a modification to one of the components of an engine
# or abstract engine. All modifications must be expressible as
# adjustments to the parameters of the component. In mathematical
# terms, a hit is a function whose input is the set of parameter
# values of a component and whose output is a new set of
# parameter values.
#
# Before implementing objects to represent hits, we start by
# defining two generic kinds of effects that a hit can have.  In
# the multivariate normal context, we can alter the mean or we can
# alter the standard deviation.


# Here is one example of a possible 'TRANSFORM' to be used in an
# 'alterMean' operation.  Each value in the mean is changed by
# adding an offset, where the offset is chosen from a normal
# distribution. Similar transforms can be defined using other
# distributions.  Constant (non-random) offsets can be obtained
# using the transform "function(x){x+OFFSET}".
normalOffset <- function(x, delta=0, sigma=1) {
  x + rnorm(length(x), delta, sigma)
}


# Here is a possible 'TRANSFORM' for an 'alterSD' operation, which
# multiplies each standard deviation by a positive value chosen
# from an inverse gamma distribution. Constant multiples can be
# obtained using the transform "function(x){x*SCALE}".
invGammaMultiple <- function(x, shape, rate) {
  x / rgamma(length(x), shape=shape, rate=rate)
}

# then  Sigma = Delta %*% R %*% Delta.  So, we can change the
