# Now we create the general MVN class. The implementation is
# designed for efficiency when generating new samples, since
# we expect to do this several times.  Basically, this class
# separates the 'mvrnorm' function from the 'MASS' library into
# several steps.  The computationally expensive step (when the
# dimension is large) is the eigenvector decomposition of the
# covariance matrix. This step is performed at construction and
# the pieces are stored in the object.
